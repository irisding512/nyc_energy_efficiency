<h2>Background</h2>

For this project, I was inspired by how digital twin technology can be used to develop smarter cities.

Digital twin technology has previously been used in New York City by Columbia researchers to optimize traﬀic management systems in Harlem. 
Sensors from roadside infrastructure and local vehicles provide data for machine learning models to simulate traﬀic flows, providing a foundation for smarter driving assistant applications.

Engineering buildings so they use less energy in their daily operations is one of the most cost-effective ways to fight the effects of climate change while reducing costs for both consumers and businesses. 
As the most populous city in America, New York City can benefit from an increase in energy efficient solutions - although just 1/35 of the size of Massachusetts, the city uses the same amount of electricity as the entire state.
